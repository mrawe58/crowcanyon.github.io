    Peggy Nelson is President’s Professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and Vice Dean of Barrett Honors College at Arizona State University. She has conducted research in the Mimbres region of southwest New Mexico for over 30 years, collaborating for the past 20 years with Dr. Michelle Hegmon. Their work focuses primarily on the Classic to Postclassic transformation. Nelson’s 1999 book, [*Mimbres During the 12th Century: Abandonment, Continuity, and Reorganization*](http://www.amazon.com/Mimbres-during-Twelfth-Century-Reorganization/dp/0816518688), derives from that research. Her 2010 book [*Mimbres Lives and Landscapes*](https://sarweb.org/?sar_press_mimbres_lives_and_landscapes), edited with Hegmon, brings many specialists together in a popular book about archaeology and Mimbres culture. Most recently she leads two interdisciplinary research teams. The first addresses social-ecological issues concerning vulnerability and resilience for prehistoric small-scale farmers in the US Southwest (600–1500 CE) and the lessons learned from this research for contemporary issues of resilience and sustainability. This work has been published as a [Special Feature](http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art25/) for the journal *Ecology and Society*. The second is a collaboration with the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization to assess the role of human-made vulnerabilities in the scale of impacts from climate challenges. This work directly addresses concerns within the disaster management community and was [recently published](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/298.full) in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. Nelson was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008. She has been named Centennial Professor, Parents Association Professor of the Year, and ASU President’s Professor in recognition of her teaching.

    Chip Stanish is a professor in the department of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Cotsen Institute.  His research interests include Andean archaeology, complex society, and political economy. The Lake Titicaca Basin in highland Peru and Bolivia represents one of the great centers of preindustrial civilization in the world. His survey and excavations along the shores and on the islands of Lake Titicaca have uncovered numerous sites that span more than six millennia of human occupation. Recently, he has been excavating the remains of a house from the seventh to ninth century AD on the Island of Esteves, near the northern shore of the lake. This architecture was associated with a large pyramid and temple complex that was the center of the Tiwanaku (ca. AD 400–1000) state's provincial administration of this territory. The high quality of pottery and other objects associated with this house complex indicates that it was inhabited by an elite group, possibly Tiwanaku administrators or artisans. Chip has numerous publications and grant awards, and is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Lloyd Cotsen Chair of Archaeology, and a Senior Fellow at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library.

    Joe Watkins is the Supervisory Anthropologist and Chief of the Tribal Relations and American Cultures Program for the National Park Service in Washington, DC. Dr. Watkins was most recently the Director of the Native American Studies Program at the University of Oklahoma. He was an Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico from 2003–2007. He is Choctaw Indian, and has been involved in archaeology for more than forty years. Joe’s doctoral research examined archaeologists’ responses to questionnaire scenarios concerning their perceptions of American Indian issues. His current study interests include the ethical practice of anthropology and the study of anthropology’s relationships with descendant communities and Aboriginal populations, and he has published numerous articles on these topics. His first book [*Indigenous Archaeology: American Indian Values and Scientific Practice*](http://www.amazon.com/Indigenous-Archaeology-American-Scientific-Archaeologies/dp/0742503291/) is in its second printing, and his latest book, [*Sacred Sites and Repatriation*](http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Repatriation-Contemporary-Native-American/dp/0791079694/) (2005) is aimed toward creating an awareness of Native American issues among high school students. Dr. Watkins serves as a mediator between various academic disciplines and members of Indigenous groups. Using such an approach, he hopes to continue developing the Native American Studies Program so that its students will serve as cultural liaisons to translate information back and forth between Native American tribes and the institutions that impact them.
