    Karen R. Adams (PhD University of Arizona 1988). An independent consultant, Karen currently serves as the archaeobotanical analyst at Crow Canyon. Karen trains and supervises summer interns in the analysis of archaeobotanical samples. In addition, she is working on a synthesis of Crow Canyon's archaeobotanical projects.

    Karen has been a full-time practicing archaeobotanist in the US Southwest for over 40 years, and has experience in all major Southwestern US culture areas including in Chihuahua, Mexico. She also has experience in all time periods from the Archaic to the Historic. She has an extensive publication list that includes journal articles, book chapters, and contract literature reports (available on request). She has written about the archaeological plant record from the standpoint of individual plants, ancient human communities, geographical sub-regions, and the US Southwest as a whole. Her double-training in Anthropology (1968 BA, Miami University, Ohio) and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (1988 PhD, University of Arizona) has allowed her to integrate both disciplines in all projects that she works on. Her most recent publications include a study of a poorly known New World domesticate, little barley grass; a synthesis of the archaeology and agronomy of ancient maize farming; and tobacco found inside yucca quids recovered from Antelope Cave in northwestern Arizona.

However, most of his research has been in the lab, studying ancient animal bones, with a focus on the American Southwest. He has taught archaeology at Simon Fraser University (Canada) for more than 30 years, where he has served as department chair, dean of graduate studies, and provost and vice-president, academic (to 2016). He has also been active in the Society for American Archaeology as a director and member of various committees. He currently serves as president of the Western Canadian Universities Marine Sciences Society that operates the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In addition to his work with CCAC, his most recent research concerns bison hunting on the Plains and the analysis of faunal remains from Pueblo Bonito (New Mexico). He is also working with the Treaty 8 Tribal Association in northeast British Columbia to create multiple ways to access information about Tse'K'wa (Charlie Lake Cave)—a site that documents First Nations land use of the Peace River region since the end of the last ice age.

    Tim first tried his hand at archaeology in southern France and was trained in the archaeology of the Woodland-period US Southeast, but for most of his career has worked to understand the climate, environment, population, and cultural dynamics of prehispanic Pueblo societies in southwestern Colorado and the northern Rio Grande of New Mexico. He is especially interested in developing new, better, and often quantitative ways to study these societies that allow us to begin from very small spatial and social scales (such as households) and rigorously scale up to the sorts of systems-level phenomena that we ordinarily study in the archaeological record. Particular interests include the causes and consequences of population growth, conflict, and inequality in Neolithic societies.

She and her Veterinarian husband John owned and operated a Small Animal Clinic in Santa Fe, NM for over 25 years. As a veterinary technician she was also a poultry consultant for local 4-H and NM Extension Service youth groups. Academic studies in Anthropology at Santa Fe Community College and Ft Lewis College led to research opportunities with the Office of Archaeological Studies (Museum of New Mexico), the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, CO, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Cortez, CO and Mesa Verde National Park. Mentored and challenged by colleagues, she has devoted the last 20 years to experimentation in artifact analysis, faunal interpretative research and the application of biology and agricultural science to understanding ancient husbandry, especially turkeys. Research collaborations at Crow Canyon have produced several analysis protocols, contributions to reports, and popular articles. Ongoing research with ancient turkey faunal assemblages, ancient genetics, diet and ritual burials plus gizzard stone studies has continued to generate new collaborations. She has shared her findings with archaeologists through presentations and posters at numerous SW Regional and National conferences. Publications in the journal *Kiva* (2012) and *American Antiquity* (2016) further the understanding of the ancient turkey/human interaction in the American Southwest.

He also was a senior researcher on the Village Ecodynamics Project. He continues to work with Crow Canyon on a variety of research projects.

    Scott's research focuses on historical anthropology, or the integration of theory and data from many fields to understand the long-term histories of indigenous peoples. He is especially interested in the causes and consequences of major transitions—periods when new societies formed, old ones collapsed, or new scales of organization emerged. As examples, he has investigated Tewa Pueblo origins in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico; the growth and collapse of villages in the Mesa Verde region of Colorado; and more recently, the accumulation of social complexity on a global scale. He is currently working on the Neolithic Revolution in the U.S. Southwest in collaboration with Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History, the emergence of towns in the Tewa Basin, and complex systems approaches to human societies in collaboration with the Santa Fe Institute. Since 2003 he has been involved with the Village Ecodynamics Project, a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration that investigates long-term human-environment interactions in the U.S. Southwest. Prior to coming to the University of Colorado Boulder, he was Director of Research at the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Cortez, Colorado, and an Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
