Prior to joining Crow Canyon in 2016, Kyle was a postdoctoral research fellow at WSU as part of the <a href="http://www.envirecon.org/" target="_blank">SKOPE project</a>—Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments—where he developed large-scale, high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions for the southwestern US. Kyle is a long-time member of the <a href="http://village.anth.wsu.edu" target="_blank">Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP)</a>, and has been collaborating with Crow Canyon researchers for almost a decade.
