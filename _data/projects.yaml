    SKOPE is an effort to bring paleoenvirnomental data to researchers and the public
    through an intuitive, map-based user interface, and also to improve the capacity
    of researchers to do reproducible paleoenvirnomenal research.
    The project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon, Washington State University,
    Arizona State University, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
    at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

    The Pueblo Farming Project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon and Hopi
    traditional farmers to understand ancient maize (corn) agriculture in the Mesa Verde region
    through documenting traditional ecological knowledge, experimental gardens, and genetic analysis.
    Since summer of 2009, Hopi farmers have traveled to Crow Canyon to plant maize gardens on the
    Crow Canyon campus. We've found that traditional varieties of Hopi corn, when planted using 
    Hopi cultivation methods, grow well in the Mesa Verde region.
