#    The Inspiring Students Project is a partnership between Pueblo communities and the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center to develop student programs focused on issues that Pueblo people themselves have identified as priorities: the preservation of their native languages, cultures, and histories; providing culturally relevant educational experiences that inspire students to succeed academically and professionally; and creating more economic opportunities within native communities.

    The Pueblo Farming Project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon and Hopi
    traditional farmers to understand ancient maize (corn) agriculture in the Mesa Verde region
    through documenting traditional ecological knowledge, experimental gardens, and genetic analysis.
    Since summer of 2009, Hopi farmers have traveled to Crow Canyon to plant maize gardens on the
    Crow Canyon campus. We've found that traditional varieties of Hopi corn, when planted using 
    Hopi cultivation methods, grow well in the Mesa Verde region.

    Starting in 2011, Crow Canyon archaeologists, assisted by student and adult participants in the Center’s archaeology programs, began field investigations at selected Basketmaker III sites in Indian Camp Ranch. Because relatively little is known about this early chapter in Pueblo history―and because this was Crow Canyon’s first foray into Basketmaker archaeology―researchers had many questions. Where did the Pueblo people who first settled the central Mesa Verde region come from? How and why did early communities develop? What impact did a growing farming population have on the environment? And what are the environmental and social legacies of the Basketmakers on later Pueblo populations in the region?

    The VEP is a network of archaeologists, geologists, 
    geographers, computer scientists and economists seeking to explain key 
    aspects of the late prehistory of the northern Southwest through empirical 
    research and modeling.

    SKOPE is an effort to bring paleoenvironmental data to researchers and the public
    through an intuitive, map-based user interface, and also to improve the capacity
    of researchers to do reproducible paleoenvironmental research.
    The project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon, Washington State University,
    Arizona State University, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
    at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
