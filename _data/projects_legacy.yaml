    [The Duckfoot site](http://www.crowcanyon.org/index.php/occasional-papers) investigation was the first major research project to be undertaken by the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. Field and laboratory studies were designed to increase our understanding of the prehistoric occupation of the area just to the west of Cortez, CO, during the mid- to late ninth century. The project was also where Crow Canyon's educational goal of increasing public awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the archaeological research process was developed and refined. The Duckfoot site remains one of the most thoroughly-documented and interpreted Pueblo I sites in the Central Mesa Verde region, and the research was designed as a comparative study to the recently completed Dolores Archaeological Program. In contrast to later Crow Canyon excavations, the Duckfoot site was almost completely excavated as a "strong archaeological case" because of its thorough dating and rich floor assemblages.

    The Sand Canyon Archaeological Project studied settlement in the Sand Canyon locality, focusing on the A.D. 1000–1290 period. Beginning in 1983 and continuing to 1993, the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center conducted extensive archaeological investigations in an effort to better understand the ancient Puebloan communities of the mesa and canyon country west of Mesa Verde National Park. The research at [Sand Canyon Pueblo (Site 5MT765)](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/SandCanyon/Text/scpw_contentsvolume.asp) was a major component of the Sand Canyon Archaeological Project. This project also included intensive excavations at a small site (Green Lizard) and a medium-size site ([Castle Rock Pueblo](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/CastleRock/Text/crpw_contentsvolume.asp)), probabilistically designed [test excavations at numerous small sites](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/SiteTesting/start.asp), intensive survey of approximately 30 km<sup>2</sup> in the Sand Canyon locality, and paleoenvironmental modeling. Several published accounts cover aspects of the history of research at Sand Canyon Pueblo in the context of the larger regional project. The 1992 Sand Canyon Archaeological Project progress report devotes a chapter to the excavations at Sand Canyon Pueblo, and various components of the larger project are described in other chapters. The [Site Testing Program](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/SiteTesting/start.asp), which consisted of small-scale test excavations at 13 sites in the Sand Canyon locality, was an essential component of the larger project.

    In 1993, the Village Mapping Project was initiated to obtain detailed surfacial information about Pueblo II–III villages outside the Sand Canyon locality. Thirty villages were initially mapped using orthorectified aerial imagery. Six of the 30 centers were then chosen for intensive mapping, architectural analysis, and a chronological analysis of pottery sherds on the modern ground surface: Albert Porter Pueblo, the Bass Site Complex, Seven Towers Pueblo, Cannonball Ruins, Woods Canyon Pueblo, and Hedley Main Ruin.

    Crow Canyon archaeologists designed the Village Testing Project to complement the Center's earlier research in the nearby Sand Canyon locality. Our research in the Sand Canyon locality suggested that large villages had formed rapidly in the mid-1200s as people moved from small upland settlements to large villages in canyon environments. The Village Testing Project focused on the investigation of large, late sites outside the locality in an effort to determine whether this aggregation might have been part of a larger phenomenon in the central Mesa Verde region. The testing program conducted at [Woods Canyon Pueblo](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/WoodsCanyon/Text/wcpw_contentsvolume.asp) and Woods Canyon Reservoir (Site 5MT12086) examined whether the changes through time in settlement patterns, subsistence practices, and the use of the cultural landscape that were identified in the Sand Canyon locality also occurred in the Woods Canyon community. Crow Canyon also conducted limited testing at [Yellow Jacket Pueblo](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/YellowJacket/Text/yjpw_contentsvolume.asp) and the Hedley Site Complex.

    *Communities through Time: Migration, Cooperation, and Conflict* was a regional research project that examined the development and abandonment of ancient Puebloan communities in the Mesa Verde archaeological region from A.D. 900 to 1300, incorporating data gathered at the residential, community, and regional levels. The project included excavations at [Shields Pueblo](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/Shields/Shields_Pueblo_Final.pdf) in the Sand Canyon locality and at [Albert Porter Pueblo](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/AlbertPorter/Albert_Porter_Pueblo_Final.pdf) in the Woods Canyon locality. The excavations at Shields Pueblo were designed primarily to collect artifact and ecofact assemblages from residential structures occupied and abandoned between A.D. 1050 and 1225, the interval during which Shields Pueblo is thought to have been a focal location within the larger Goodman Point community. The focus of community-level research involves integrating Shields Pueblo into the larger framework of the surrounding natural environment and cultural landscape defined by the numerous prehistoric settlements surrounding both Goodman Point and Shields pueblos. Regional-level research compared the Goodman Point Community with 26 other, similarly long-lasting communities in the Mesa Verde region and other Mesa Verde-region community centers investigated by Crow Canyon. The overarching goal of the Albert Porter Pueblo excavations was to reconstruct the historic development of the village and the associated community. The resulting reconstruction identifies multiple periods of occupation, documents population growth and decline through time, and addresses the emergence of the settlement as a community center. The presence of a Chaco period great house and a dense cluster of associated smaller habitations suggest that Albert Porter Pueblo served as a community center. Crow Canyon’s research at Albert Porter Pueblo provides important new insights into the historical development, population dynamics, and human environmental impacts of ancestral Pueblo communities in the central Mesa Verde region.

    The Goodman Point Archaeological Project builds on the preceding community studies and involves excavations at the large village of Goodman Point Pueblo and surrounding smaller sites. Phase I of the study—[Goodman Point Pueblo Excavations](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/GoodmanPoint/interim_reports/2005_2008/GPP_interim_report_2005_2008.pdf)—was conducted from 2005 through 2008; it involved test excavations at Goodman Point Pueblo (Site 5MT604), the large village that served as the focal point of a large community in the late A.D. 1200s. Phase II of the project—[Goodman Point Community Testing](http://www.crowcanyon.org/ResearchReports/GoodmanPoint/interim_reports/2010/text_2010.pdf)—involves test excavations at multiple smaller sites surrounding the large village, including a variety of habitation sites, an ancient road, and areas that might have been agricultural fields, as well as testing of the Harlan Great Kiva site. We are also ivestigating the relationship of Goodman Point to Sand Canyon Pueblo as one of the few (and, perhaps, only) multi-village polities in the region. The final report for the Goodman Point Archaeological Project is nearing completion.
