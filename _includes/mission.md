### Mission
The Crow Canyon Research Institute is dedicated to the belief that archaeology can contribute in substantive ways to public discourse on a wide variety of issues that challenge society in the twenty-first century.

Established in 2014, the Institute consists of an interdisciplinary network of scholars—archaeologists, economists, geographers, sociologists, educators, and indigenous cultural specialists, among others—whose collaborative approach to research is especially suited to addressing “big questions” with large and complex datasets. As part of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center, the Institute is uniquely positioned to leverage more than three decades of archaeological inquiry—and an extensive database—in support of sustained research leading to a better understanding of the human past and a clearer vision of society’s path forward. 

Projects conducted under the aegis of the Institute address a wide variety of interrelated issues relevant not only to archaeologists but to educators, policy makers, [advocacy groups], and indigenous peoples:

Human-environment relationships: What effect do people have on the natural environment? How does a changing environment affect human society? An understanding of how humans have responded to environmental change in the past can inform discussions of environmental policy today.

Economic systems: Studies of economic performance in ancient societies worldwide provide valuable historical and cross-cultural perspectives on long-term economic sustainability and unsustainability.

Social complexity: Human societies have grown exponentially in scale and complexity over the past 10,000 years. Institute studies help identify the factors that shape the development human societies and create an appreciation for human cultural diversity. On a planet that today is inhabited by more than 7 billion people, the past can teach us about the social frameworks that are needed to manage future growth. 

Indigenous archaeology: Archaeology conducted by indigenous peoples and in collaboration with indigenous people promotes respect for different cultures, traditional knowledge, and the full range of creative solutions that different peoples have brought to bear on problems common to all societies, past and present. The Institute will facilitate these collaborative endeavors and support the work of indigenous scholars who seek to develop an archaeology based on indigenous perspectives. 

Cultural and scientific literacy: As a social science that integrates the “hard” sciences into its practice, archaeology is an excellent way for students to acquire basic cultural and scientific literacy—and to learn how to apply those skills in real life.   

The ultimate goal of the Institute is to offer research-based solutions to real problems. It’s an ambitious goal, but the potential exists for archaeology—long regarded as simply the study of antiquities—to provide fresh perspectives on some of the most intransigent, and controversial, issues of our time.
