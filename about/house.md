### The Research Institute House

Visiting researchers at Crow Canyon are housed at the Research Institute house, less than a mile from the Crow Canyon campus in rural Colorado. The house provides a relaxing environment for research, a substantial research library (in addition to the research library at Crow Canyon), and laboratory space. Researchers at the Institute house can enjoy a direct connection to Crow Canyon's high-speed internet and research database.
