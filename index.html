                    <p>The Research Institute at <a href="http://www.crowcanyon.org" title="Crow Canyon Archaeological Center">Crow Canyon Archaeological Center</a> is dedicated to the belief that archaeology can address many of the challenges facing society in the twenty-first century. We are an interdisciplinary network of scholars—archaeologists, economists, geographers, sociologists, educators, and indigenous cultural specialists, among others—whose collaborative approach to research is especially suited to addressing <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/3/879.full.pdf" title="Grand Challenges for Archaeology">big questions</a> with large and complex datasets.

                    <p>Institute research will expand the Crow Canyon’s capacity in all three of its <a href="http://www.crowcanyon.org/index.php/about-us" title="Crow Canyon mission">mission areas</a>: long-term multidisciplinary archaeological research, education about humans past and present, and partnerships with American Indians. As part of the Crow Canyon, researchers at the Institute can leverage more than three decades of archaeological inquiry—and an extensive database—in support of sustained research leading to a better understanding of the human past and a clearer vision of society’s path forward.

It’s ambitious, but the potential exists for archaeology—long regarded as simply the study of antiquity—to provide fresh perspectives on some of the most intransigent, and controversial, issues of our time.</p>
