A [new website]({{ site.url }}/) for the Research Institute at Crow Canyon was launched on May 5, 2016 as a subdomain of Crow Canyon's main website: [institute.crowcanyon.org]({{ site.url }}/). The Research Institute is dedicated to the belief that archaeology can address many of the challenges facing society in the twenty-first century. Institute research will expand Crow Canyon’s capacity in all three of its mission areas: long-term archaeological research, education about humans past and present, and partnerships with American Indians. As part of Crow Canyon, researchers at the Institute can leverage more than three decades of archaeological inquiry—and an extensive database—in support of sustained research leading to a better understanding of the human past and a clearer vision of society’s path forward.

The website for the Research Institute has been built to highlight the ongoing research activities at Crow Canyon—and researchers working on them. Visitors to the site can [learn about the Research Institute and its mission]({{ site.url }}/about); get introduced to the researchers at Crow Canyon, including our research [staff]({{ site.url }}/people/#staff), [volunteers]({{ site.url }}/people/#volunteers), and external [research associates]({{ site.url }}/people/#associates); and learn about the [current and legacy research projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/) at Crow Canyon. There are also [News]({{ site.url }}/news/) and [Events]({{ site.url }}/events/) sections so people can keep up to date on the latest Research Institute happenings.

The new home for the Research Institute is [institute.crowcanyon.org]({{ site.url }}/). Come visit!
