The School for Advanced Research announced Thursday that Crow Canyon Research Associate Dr. Scott Ortman will receive the 2017 Linda S. Cordell Prize for his book *Winds from the North: Tewa Origins and Historical Archaeology*. SAR presents the Linda S. Cordell Prize every other year to a living author for a book in archaeology or anthropological archaeology that best exemplifies excellence in writing and significantly advances archaeological method, theory, or interpretation. The award recognizes innovative works that reach out to other subfields of anthropology or related disciplines. Such a book requires a sound methodological core and a style of writing that is inclusive and transparent across social science disciplines. The research approach may be grounded in archaeology or another field where archaeological data, method, and theory are brought to bear on a broader anthropological problem. The breadth of Linda Cordell’s work serves as a guide to the selection process.

Scott's book draws together research from archaeology, linguistics, cognitive psychology, physical anthropology, ethnology, and Pueblo traditional histories Ortman’s book addresses a long-standing question in Southwestern archaeology: what happened to the 13th-century inhabitants of the Mesa Verde region?

The School for Advanced Research will hold a reception during the 2017 SAA conference to present Dr. Ortman with a $5,000 check and commemorative plaque.
