Robin Lyle (MS Colorado State University 1966) is an independent researcher and turkey consultant in southwestern Colorado. She has been a laboratory volunteer, educator and collaborator at Crow Canyon Archaeological Center since 1996, contributing to numerous reports, publications and archaeological programs. Robin also has collaborated with Washington State University, Simon Fraser University, Mesa Verde National Park, the Anasazi Heritage Center, the Village Ecodynamics Project and Four Corners Research in a variety of research projects and publications. Most recently she has been working with Bill Lipe and others researching turkey domestication in the Pueblo Southwest.

Robin Lyle began her academic career in agricultural sciences, receiving a BS in Animal Science and an MS degree in Poultry Science from Colorado State University in 1966, specializing in poultry genetics. Various scientific undertakings over the ensuing decades have included: soil microbiological research with the USDA; math and science education in US Air Force schools in Europe; organizing an Agricultural session for a Los Alamos, Women In Science Conference and Peace Core Trainer for an agricultural mission to Mali, West Africa. She and her Veterinarian husband John owned and operated a Small Animal Clinic in Santa Fe, NM for over 25 years. As a veterinary technician she was also a poultry consultant for local 4-H and NM Extension Service youth groups. Academic studies in Anthropology at Santa Fe Community College and Ft Lewis College led to research opportunities with the Office of Archaeological Studies (Museum of New Mexico), the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, CO, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Cortez, CO and Mesa Verde National Park. Mentored and challenged by colleagues, she has devoted the last 20 years to experimentation in artifact analysis, faunal interpretative research and the application of biology and agricultural science to understanding ancient husbandry, especially turkeys. Research collaborations at Crow Canyon have produced several analysis protocols, contributions to reports, and popular articles. Ongoing research with ancient turkey faunal assemblages, ancient genetics, diet and ritual burials plus gizzard stone studies has continued to generate new collaborations. She has shared her findings with archaeologists through presentations and posters at numerous SW Regional and National conferences. Publications in the journal *Kiva* (2012) and *American Antiquity* (2016) further the understanding of the ancient turkey/human interaction in the American Southwest.
