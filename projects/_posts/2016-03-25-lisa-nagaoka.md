Lisa Nagaoka (PhD University of Washington 2000) is an Associate Professor in the Geography Department at the University of North Texas. She collaborates with Crow Canyon as a zooarchaeologist and as a Principal Investigator on a National Science Foundation grant titled *Collaborative Research: Modeling Crop Failure Potential in Late Pueblo III Mesa Verde Villages*.

Lisa trained as a zooarchaeologist, but she has broad interests in the study of human-environment interactions. Her research focuses on a range of issues from archaeological method and theory, philosophy of science, conservation biology, and biogeography. But it also encompasses topics such as urban sustainability and women in science. As an archaeologist, Lisa has worked previously in the Pacific Islands (New Zealand, American Samoa, Cook Islands, Hawaii). Her current archaeological research is in the arid environments of the Southwest U.S. and in western Argentina. Lisa is an associate professor in the Department of Geography at the University of North Texas, and is affiliated with the Institute of Applied Sciences, and the Environmental Science PhD program at UNT.
